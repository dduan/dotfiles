# Daniel Duan's Dotfiles managed by Home Manager

These are dotfiles for macOS and non-NixOS Linux. They may work on NixOS as well but I'm not using them that way yet.

## Assumptions

These are things not managed by home-manager. They should exist somehow.

- An OS-provided Alacritty
- An OS-provided SF Mono font
- Multi-user installation of Nix
